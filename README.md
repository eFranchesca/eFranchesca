- 👋 Hi, I’m @eFranchesca, I prefer just Eva (pronounced Ava).
- 👀 I’m interested in new/emerging computer technology and cyber security. I look forward to a future where I'm no longer going to my customer service job and working in a position where I'm potentially making everyday technology safer. I know I have a lot to learn, but with every project I work on I am one step closer to reaching my goals. And Lol, when I'm not on my computer I love exploring the great state of Florida 🌴😎🌴
- 🌱 I’m currently working with CSS, HTML, JS, and hosting, to name the obvious, but recently I finished a project that is responsive and another that utilized React.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating, currently I am working on my resume and profile page. I would love to network with others in the tech industry.
- 🙏🏼 I would like to thank eveyone at Shecodes, without them I likely would not be coding right now. They are a wonderful and supportive community! (I am a Shecodes alumni and this is my unpaid and unsolicited opinion)  Visit Shecodes at https://shecodes.io
