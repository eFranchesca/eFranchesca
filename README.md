- 👋 Hi, I’m @eFranchesca, I prefer just Eva (pronounced Ava).
- 👀 I’m interested in new/emerging computer technology and cyber security. I look forward to a future where I'm no longer going to my customer service job and working in a position where I'm potentially making everyday technology safer. Lol, when I'm not on my computer I love exploring the great state of Florida 🌴😎🌴
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about CSS, HTML, JS, and hosting, just to mention my current project.
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborating in the future, but for now I'm focusing on the classes I'm taking at https://shecodes.io
